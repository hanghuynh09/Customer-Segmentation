### CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION USING RFM METHOD

#### INTRODUCTION

**Customer segmentation** is a crucial strategy in marketing that involves dividing a customer base into distinct groups based on specific characteristics. One of the most effective methods for achieving this is through RFM analysis. RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, which are the three key metrics used to evaluate and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

**Recency** refers to the time elapsed since a customer's last purchase. Customers who have purchased recently are more likely to buy again than those who haven't made a purchase in a while.

**Frequency** measures how often a customer makes a purchase within a specific period. Frequent buyers are usually more loyal and potentially more valuable to the business.

**Monetary** value assesses the total amount a customer has spent during a specified period. Customers who spend more are considered more valuable.

RFM analysis not only helps in understanding the current value of customers but also in predicting their future behavior. This predictive capability makes it an indispensable tool for businesses aiming to enhance customer relationship management (CRM), optimize marketing efforts, and improve overall business performance.
